# NYC Taxi Data Analysis1 ðŸš•ðŸ“Š

## Overview  
This project analyzes New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) trip data. The dataset includes details about trip distances, fares, passenger counts, tips, payment methods, and vendors. The goal of this analysis is to clean the data, explore patterns, and generate insights that can help taxi operators, analysts, and the NYC TLC understand ride behavior and fare structures.

## Objectives  
- Clean and preprocess raw TLC trip data.  
- Explore trip distances, fares, and unusual values.  
- Compare rides by vendor and payment type.  
- Analyze tipping behavior by credit card vs cash.  
- Study passenger counts and their impact on average tips.  
- Identify the most useful variables for building predictive models.  

## Key Insights  
- The longest rides are around 33 miles, while the most expensive rides donâ€™t always match the longest distances.  
- Credit card rides include tipping, while cash rides usually report zero tips.  
- Vendor 1 and Vendor 2 have similar average total fares (~$16).  
- Total amount and trip distance are the two most important variables for predicting fares.  

## Technologies Used  
- **Python** (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  
- **GitHub** for project sharing
